Smithy
======

Smithy is a Discord utility bot designed with some very specific features
in mind.

It should be considered as a replacement for my InfoBot and RelayBot
projects, and will include all the functionality from both - while being
wrapped up in a user-friendly, publicly-hosted package.

For now, though, we're not ready for use. Watch this space!
